  No mistakes. Always be sure and in control. Follow the principle of 100% correct practice: to make a mistake is to learn incorrect things, and to confuse that which you already know.
  Slower is faster. Speed comes from certainty. The more you type things correctly, no matter how slow it has to be, the more certain you will be, and the faster you will become a proficient typist. Increase speed only when you feel sure enough to do so.
  Don't look at the keyboard! If you don't know where a key is, look at the keyboard to find it, then look away and type the key. Do not guess; always be sure.
  Type to a steady rhythm. Generally, the time between keystrokes should be the same, giving you a sense of flow and the ability to scan ahead at a constant speed.
  Relax. No unnecessary or dysfunctional tension. Enjoy the rhythm of your own typing!
  Hit the keys squarely in the center. If you find you aren't consistently doing so, SLOW DOWN!!! It should feel good to type!
  
  
  How to improve your typing speed

If you want to type faster, there are just a few things you should first focus on. The first is trying to build muscle memory. Successfully building muscle memory takes practice typing. You should try to practice typing on rankedtyping.com for 15 minutes each day. Once you're muscles start to remember words, your WPM can increase beyond 100WPM. Muscle memory is when you will see your biggest typing speed improvements, because your fingers will be able to type out a word without you thinking about typing at all. This is why this is the first priority, and all you can do to improve that is practice typing here. Once you get there, that means your brain is free to read the input that you need to type.

Second, you need to try to improve your accuracy. Slowing down just enough to improve your accuracy will be very helpful in improving your typing speed. Each character you type wrong will be counted against your WPM score. So if you made 10 mistakes, you just lost 10 WPM! It's very important to fix errors as fast as possible, and there are some ways to improve how fast you can correct errors which will in turn increase your WPM. My favorite is to use control + backspace (Option+backspace for mac users) together to delete the entire word to the left of your cursor in one keystroke. This means instead of pushing backspace 5 times to delete the entire word, you push those two buttons and you just saved yourself 3 keystrokes!

The last thing to focus on is learning how to type without looking at the keyboard. This will dramtically improve your speed as you can work towards muscle memory. They are tied together in that you should learn muscle memory by typing without looking. You may be slow at first, but learning this way will not inhibit your typing speed later on.
What to focus on to improve your WPM

  Do not push each key down any more than you need to register the keystroke.
  Do not hover your hands high above the keyboard.
  Keep your movements between keys as short as possible.
  Keep your fingers close to your base position.
  Leearn to type without looking at the keyboard.
  Do not rush. Speed will come with practice. Reduce errors and contnue to practice until your muscles remember how to type each character.
  Read ahead to the next word while you are finishing typing the current word. This will gie you enough time to process the next word you are going to type.
  Take a break if you feel that you are getting distracted or not giving it your best effort, as this will increase your rate of errors.

Keyboard shortcuts that will improve your WPM

Note: Mac users will use the option key instead of Control

  Ctrl + Backspace will delete the entire word to the left of your cursor. Very helpful if you want to start a word over.
  Ctrl + Delete will delete the entire word to the right of your cursor. Very helpful if you want to change a sentence.

Maintain good posture while typing

  Sit up straight and remember to keep your back straight.
  Keep your elbows slightly bent.
  Directly face the scren with your head tilted slightly forward.
  Keep body weight off of your wrists. You can however, rest your wrists on the table before the keyboard.

What keys should each finger use while typing.

  Your left hand fingers whould rest on ASDF
  Your right hand fingers whould rest on JKL;
  The shift key opposite of the key you wish to capitalize should be used.
  Both thumbs should rest on the spacebar. You are welcome to use whichever one is more comofortable to you.

Typing Rhythm

  Try to keep a brisk pace, and maintain that pace so you can read ahead
  Don't type too fast to where your accuracy starts to suffer.
  Typing fast is not only about keystrokes, but reading. In essence you are training both skills up at the same time.

Don't forget to rest and stretch

It's important not to push too hard for too long. If your wrists are starting to hurt you should stretch them out, and make sure to take breaks. Start by grabbing your fingers with one hand and stretch out my arm to full length and pull on your fingers back gently. Then stretch your fingers by opening and closing them and rotating your wrists.
Typing Terminology

  WPM stands for words per minute. This is generally defined by each keystroke that generates a charcter (including spaces).
  Good keystrokes stands for each key you pressed correctly.
  Bad keystrokes stands for each key you failed to press correctly.
  Accuracy is the number of good keystrokes compares to bad keystrokes
