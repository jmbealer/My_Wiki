Natural Numbers
  Notation
  Algebraic Properties:
      Closure: For all natural numbers a,b, both a+b and a×b are natural numbers.
      Associativity: For all natural numbers a,b,c, a + (b + c) = (a + b ) + c and a × (b × c) = (a × b) × c.
      Commutativity: For all natural number a,b, a + b = b + a and a × b = b × a.
      Exisetence of identity elements:
      Distributivity:
      No Non-Zero Zero Divisors:
      Addition Ordering:
      Multiplication Ordering:
