### Python Architecture

Let’s now talk about Python architecture and its usual flow –

**Parser**:
It uses the source code to generate an abstract syntax tree.

**Compiler**:
It turns the abstract syntax tree into Python bytecode.

**Interpreter**:
It executes the code line by line in a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) fashion.
It is interpreted(executed) line by line. This makes it easy to test and debug.
